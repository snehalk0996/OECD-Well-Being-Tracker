# OECD-Well-Being-Tracker
The OECD Global Well-being Tracker is a dynamic, multi-panel data application designed to provide users with a comprehensive, interactive view of well-being across OECD countries from 2004 to 2024. Built with Plotly Studio, this app empowers users to explore, compare, and analyze key indicators across eleven core domains of well-being.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for the OECD Global Well-being Tracker stemmed from a desire to move beyond purely economic metrics like GDP when evaluating a country's success. I was intrigued by the OECD's Better Life Index framework, which uses eleven distinct domains—from Health and Safety to Work-Life Balance and Access to Green Spaces—to offer a more holistic view of human welfare. I wanted to build a tool that could bring this massive, nuanced dataset to life, allowing anyone to quickly compare and analyze what truly constitutes a "good life" across developed nations.

## What it does
The OECD Global Well-being Tracker is an interactive data application built in Plotly Studio that allows users to explore, analyze, and compare quality of life and well-being indicators across OECD countries from 2004 to 2024.

It functions as a dynamic dashboard that:

Enables Deep Dive Analysis: Users can select any of the 11 well-being domains (like Health, Safety, or Work-Life Balance) and choose specific metrics (like 'Life Expectancy at Birth' or 'Access to Green Space') to analyze. Visualizes Spatial Trends: It displays the selected metric on an interactive Choropleth Map with a Year Slider, revealing how well-being metrics vary geographically and change over time. Provides Contextual KPIs: The app features Data Cards that give instant summaries, showing a country's Current Value, its Change Over Time (Delta), and its Ranking among OECD nations. Compares Country Performance: It includes a Line Chart to directly compare the long-term trends of multiple countries simultaneously.

## How we built it
I began by loading the comprehensive OECD-wellbeing.csv dataset into Plotly Studio. The structure of the data, with its many rows for Country, Measure, Domain, and Year, presented a perfect foundation for a dynamic dashboard. Data Preparation: The first step in Studio was to ensure the categorical columns (Domain, Measure, Country) were correctly identified and that the OBS_VALUE was ready for visualization. Interactive Layout: I designed a three-panel layout centered around interactivity: Filtering Controls: I set up cascading dropdown menus for Domain and Measure, allowing users to drill down from the high-level topic (e.g., Health) to a specific metric (e.g., Life Expectancy at Birth). Geographical Context: I used a Choropleth Map to display the selected metric, tied to a Year Slider so users could watch well-being metrics change spatially over time. Trend Analysis: A dynamic Line Chart was added to compare up to five countries' performance over the 2004−2024 period. Data Cards (KPIs): I integrated custom Data Card components to instantly show the Current Value, the Change Over Time (Delta), and the country's Ranking, providing quick policy-relevant summaries.

## Challenges we ran into
The primary challenge was data sparsity and inconsistency across years for certain measures within the large dataset. Not every country reported every measure in every year. I overcame this by: Data Handling: Setting the visualizations to gracefully handle null values by interpolating or simply displaying the last available data point. User Messaging: Using dynamic text to inform the user which year the displayed data corresponds to, ensuring transparency and data fidelity, especially for the Change Over Time metric.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of transforming the large, complex OECD well-being data—covering 11 domains and 73 metrics—into a unified, user-friendly analytical tool. Our key accomplishments include: Dynamic Data Contextualization: Successfully implementing dynamic Data Cards that instantly calculate and display the Current Value, Change Over Time (Delta), and Country Ranking for any metric selected by the user, providing immediate, policy-relevant insight. Intuitive Exploration: Creating a seamless, interactive experience using cascading filters for Domain and Measure, allowing users to drill down from high-level topics to granular metrics without ever needing to touch the raw data. Effective Visual Storytelling: Leveraging the power of Plotly's Choropleth Map and Time-Series Line Charts to simultaneously analyze geographical distribution and long-term trends, which is critical for understanding global progress in areas like Access to Green Spaces and Health.

## What we learned
Building this project taught me several valuable lessons about data application development in a no-code environment: Handling Multi-Dimensional Data: I learned how to effectively manage a dataset with many dimensions by using cascading filters to simplify the user experience. This is crucial when dealing with complex datasets like the OECD's. The Power of Context: The most effective visualization wasn't the raw chart, but the combination of the map, the line chart, and the Data Card metrics. Contextual KPIs (like the Delta and Ranking) transformed the data from mere numbers into actionable insights. Design for Clarity: The process reinforced the importance of a clean, structured design (like the suggested Corporate and Industrial theme), ensuring the analytical power wasn't lost in visual clutter.

## What's next for OECD Global Well-Being Tracker
Our vision for the next phase focuses on deeper demographic analysis and integration: Subgroup Analysis: Implementing new filters and visualizations that leverage the Age, Sex, and Education columns in the dataset. This will allow users to answer advanced questions, such as: "How does the 'Gender Wage Gap' differ between high school and university graduates in a specific country?" Custom Index Creation: Adding a feature where users can select multiple well-being metrics (e.g., 'Life Satisfaction' and 'Access to Green Space') and assign custom weights to them, allowing the app to calculate and visualize a Personalized Well-being Index. External Data Integration: Integrating external, supplementary datasets—like economic forecasts or climate data—to explore potential correlations with the core well-being indicators.
